- The font is Archivo, a free font which is similar to Mabry (the font on your website)
- I've put the title underneath the picture because I think it looks better even though the designs have it above. In a real setting I'd run visual ideas like this past stakeholders

TODO
Update theme based on user pref

const colorScheme = Appearance.getColorScheme();
if (colorScheme === 'dark') {
// Use dark color scheme
}

Weâ€™ve also added a hook to subscribe to state updates to the users preferences:

import { Text, useColorScheme } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
const colorScheme = useColorScheme();
return <Text>useColorScheme(): {colorScheme}</Text>;
};
